        <h1 class="title">Is Dark Souls really a great game?</h1>
        <h2 class="subt">Let's find out</h2>

        <p>To find the answer to this question, we must base ourselves on some things from this game franchise</p>
        <p>First of all, if you've never played or watched anything related to Dark Souls, I suggest you have an experience before delving into this endless story. </p>
        <p>Now, let's begin.</p>
        <p>
            We must go back in time a little, precisely during the generation of PS2 consoles, where difficult games were sold more easily,
            because the games were short and needed to pay off so that the child could stay focused on learning how to play, without many tutorials and super guides detailed as we have today,
            an example of this is Ninja Gaiden, um exemplo disso é Ninja Gaiden, onde uma speedrun hoje em dia dura 15 minutos, sendo algo simples porem dificil pra época.
        </p>
        <p>
            What am I trying to say with this? It's just that difficult games have always existed, 
            but nowadays situations are too detailed and guided, where people simply stopped trying 
            to learn and expect extremely detailed tutorials in games, making the learning experience boring and not immersive.
        </p>
        <p>Does this mean Dark Souls is bad? No, but the difference between it and other games... is the hype.
            I'm one of the biggest fans of Dark Souls IN THE WHOLE WORLD, it's a really great game, i can spend hours and hours without a break while playing, but the difference is the hype.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, the game has its peculiarities, also bringing hype for its quality and lore, where all theories may or may not meet.</p>
        
        <h3>The result then is...... Dark Souls is a great game.</h3>
